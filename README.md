# Big Url Content Extension

## Summary
This web extenstion relaxes the URLs on an HTML page to their true location. Currently only evaluating 'a' tag's href attribute. More improvements coming soon. The motivation for this is to circumnavigate trackers like doubleclick, bit.ly, etc.

## Installation

Zip `manifest.json` and `page-script.js`, and import the zip as a temporary addon to your browser. Not official yet, so it's not published.

## Compatibility
Built according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions. Should work with Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Refer to this site for more info.
